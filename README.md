Sentiment analysis of your documentation As A Service (tm).

This #AstroHackWeek community hack project uses [documentation sentiment analysis](http://nlpforhackers.io/sentiment-analysis-intro/) via the [python natural language toolkit (NLTK) package](http://www.nltk.org) to analyze the astropy docs. Our goal is to use the results to improve astropy documentation and provide a tool for other software package developers to use more user-friendly language in their docs.

Some intermediary goals are:
* Compare sentiments of subdocs of subpackages with in astropy to see if they are uniform (probably not!) and explore the differences
* Use the results to poll Astro Hack Week participants (maybe) and define what kinds of documentation language are the most user-friendly
* Write a script that can run on any Sphinx documentation build to analyze user-friendliness
* Based on the output of the script, provide concrete feedback to developers about how their documentation could be changed to be more user-friendly
